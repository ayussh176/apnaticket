# 🎫 APNATICKET – A Secure, Transparent, Agent-Free Booking Platform Using E-Rupee

APNATICKET is a full-stack FinTech + GovTech platform designed to eliminate agent-driven ticket hoarding and black marketing. It uses identity-verified booking (PAN/Aadhaar), simulates CBDC (E-Rupee) wallet payments, enforces booking limits, and ensures full auditability of public ticketing services like railways, metros, and large events.
